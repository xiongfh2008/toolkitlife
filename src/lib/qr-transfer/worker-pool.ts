// Fixed-slot pool of decode workers.
//
// The subtle part is slot identity: every worker's message handler closes over
// its own index, so growing and shrinking the pool has to leave the surviving
// workers' indices alone. Shrinking from the end is what makes that true, and
// it is why this is worth having on its own rather than inline in the receiver.
//
// Each worker holds its own ~940 KB zxing WASM instance, so the pool is also
// how the receiver reclaims that memory the moment the last frame is in.
