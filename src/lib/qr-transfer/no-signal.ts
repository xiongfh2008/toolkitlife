/**
 * When to show, and re-show, the receiver's "nothing is decoding" hint.
 *
 * Pure timing policy with no DOM in it: the rules are the part that can be
 * wrong, and the panel itself is a handful of createElement calls.
 *
 * The rules:
 * - The countdown starts when the camera does, on the short first delay.
 * - Dismissing the hint restarts the countdown on the longer delay: tapping a
 *   button does not make frames start arriving, so it does come back — but the
 *   user has already read the advice once, so it stops leaning on them.
 * - A camera restart is a fresh attempt, so it goes back to the short delay.
 * - The first frame that parses ends it for good, dismissed or not. That is the
 *   only event that actually means the link is working.
